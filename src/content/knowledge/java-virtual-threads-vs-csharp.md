title: "Java's Virtual Threads vs. C#: Concurrency Without Limits"
date: "2025-01-29"
presenter: "Matt Parker"
summary: "Matt Parker explores Java's recent introduction of virtual threads for HTTP concurrency, which overcomes the traditional limit of 200 concurrent threads. He contrasts this new approach with C#'s asynchronous model that efficiently handles high volumes of requests, highlighting the evolving landscape of concurrency in modern programming."
