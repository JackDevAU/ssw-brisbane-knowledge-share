title: "Romanizing Korean: A Deep Dive into Hangul and Unicode"
date: "2025-01-22"
presenter: "Brook Jeynes"
summary: "Brook Jeynes unpacks the complexities of the Korean writing system (Hangul), illustrating how individual consonants and vowels—called Jamo—combine to form syllable blocks. He explores different romanization systems, such as McCune–Reischauer and Revised Romanization, and explains how each handles positional sound shifts and irregularities. Brook also demonstrates a TypeScript implementation for decomposing Hangul Unicode characters and mapping them to their corresponding romanized forms."
