title: "Optimizing SSW Rewards: Caching and .NET Performance Techniques"
date: "2025-01-23"
presenter: "Jernej Kavka (JK)"
summary: "Jernej Kavka tackles severe performance bottlenecks in the SSW Rewards system by refactoring SQL queries and implementing a robust caching layer. He explains how high CPU usage and timeouts on the SQL Server were alleviated through in-memory caching, selective data retrieval, and concurrency locksâ€”ultimately speeding up the leaderboard functionality by hundreds of times. Jernej also previews how hybrid caching in .NET 10 could further streamline and future-proof the solution."
